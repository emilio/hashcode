# Hashcode attempts

This stores my personal attempt in the practice round (with unlimited time), and
my team's qualification round (in four hours) for Google's Hashcode 2016.

## Why having it here?

Just in order to not lose it. Also it was not so bad after all (even in such
a time-constrained environment as the qualification round), so I decided to make
it public.

## Why in C/C++?

The first one was in C because it seemed a simple problem to solve.

The second one (`qualification`) is in C++ (yeah, it was a bad choice, mea
culpa, and I had no time to think a lot about encapsulation, etc...).

I should have chosen a higher-level language, at least for parsing (that could
have been done in a few lines of python), but our team had no uniform skillset,
so...

The practice attempt is individual. We were four in the qualification round, but
in practice... well, read the commit log.
